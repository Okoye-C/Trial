    Oh before I forget,
    My top 5 best Naruto Characters are
    1. Itachi
    2. Naruto
    3. Obito
    4. Pain
    5. Guy

    Some of their stories are relatable while others are beautiful.

    My best female Character is Hinata, no offense but Ino and Sakura are on the same boat.

    My Regards :)
